Data structure and algorithm in Python
===========
The Repo series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view. Â 

1. concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware. 
2. deals with the more advanced engineering aspects of software, such as constructing and analyzing large programs. 
3. focuses on machines and how they execute the programs you write.
